The latest version of CORAL is able to run online. 

<h2>Easy to write and deploy</h2>

Follow the simple step by step guide under <a href='GettingStarted.md'>Getting Started</a>, or watch the<br>
screencast (coming soon) to run your first experiment in minutes. Use the examples to easily build your<br>
custom experiments, find anything you need on the web for fancy extentsions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Open and extendable</h2>

CORAL is built around open standards, the core is written in Java which is virtually able to run everywhere. Screens are displayed with the native HTML renderer of the operating system and the logic uses simple JavaScript. So you build on the knowledge of the web to program your experiments!<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Write once, run everywhere</h2>

Experiments writen in CORAL can be easily extended, manipulated and run everywhere you like. It has been tested on Linux, Windows and OSX and even features a native iOS client, the sky is the limit here...<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Easy and quick to develop and test</h2>

Everything can be edited with a standard text editor. A plugin is availble for the <a href='Eclipse.md'>Eclipse</a> IDE to even further speed up development. Need to test for 32+ participants, no worries, let a <a href='robot.md'>robot</a> do the work.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Free</h2>

CORAL comes to you free of charge for any use you like. If used in an academic context, a<br>
citation to the <a href='http://ideas.repec.org/p/qut/qubewp/wp016.html'>CORAL Working Paper</a> is required. Otherwise, in the spirit of Open Source, please contribute back and changes and improvemnts that you make to the code.
